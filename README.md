# Small Android app to help snapping and timestamping photos to a friend of mine

Photos are saved to the _Pictures_ folder on the device.

## Developers note

This is a one-evening app, based on a small [Google
tutorial](http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/training/camera/photobasics.html),
that I adopted to [RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com), which I
downloaded today for the first time. And it played well!
